This package has been deprecated in favour of the Transient Fault Handling Application Block released as part of the Enterprise Library Integration Pack for Windows Azure.
Because the Transient Fault Handling Application Block is included as a dependency, you can safely uninstall this package.

If you were configuring the Transient Fault Handling Framework in the configuration file, please note that there are some breaking changes.
